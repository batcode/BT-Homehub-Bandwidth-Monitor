BT Homehub Bandwidth Monitor
============================

This is a simple, linear, and fairly crude programme to log in to the BT Homehub, extract information including the used up- and down-stream data, and append this information to a comma-delimited file.

A short script to plot this data is included.  An example of a plot which can be generated is included as example_plot.png.

This programme was written for Linux (and should work fine on Mac) but should run on Windows with some modifications.  If there is any interest, then I will consider making these changes.

Installation instructions (for Linux) are given below.


Some information
----------------

A configuration file should be placed in ~/.bthomehubmonitor/options

The options file is very crude and consists of three parameters specified in the form "name=value", each on a separate, consecutive line.  The file named "options" is a working example.

One of the options specifies a file which stores the password used to log in to the BT Homehub.  By default this is ~/bthomehubmonitor/password, and this should contain the password in plain-text.

The programme log.py should be run periodically, for example with the following line in the crontab:

*/5 *  *  *  * python ~/git/BT-Homehub-Bandwidth-Monitor/log.py

This line will log the used data every 5 minutes.

Installation instructions
-------------------------
Run the following commands in a terminal.  You may copy-and-paste.

cd ~
mkdir .bthomehubmonitor/
mkdir git
cd git
git clone git@github.com:batcode/BT-Homehub-Bandwidth-Monitor.git
cd BT-Homehub-Bandwidth-Monitor
cp options ~/.bthomehubmonitor/
echo PASSWORD > ~/.bthomehubmonitor/password

where, instead of PASSWORD, you would type the password you use to log in to the BT Homehub.

Finally, run "crontab -e" and add the line "*/5 *  *  *  * python ~/git/BT-Homehub-Bandwidth-Monitor/log.py".

To look at data which has been gathered, run the following command:

python ~/git/BT-Homehub-Bandwidth-Monitor/plot.py
